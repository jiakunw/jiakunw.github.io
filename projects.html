                    <img src="assets/images/projects/usb.jpg" alt="usb" class="project-image">
                    <p>In the USB project, I designed and simulated a simplified
                         Serial Interface Engine (SIE) to interact with a thumb drive model, using SystemVerilog and 
                         Synopsys VCS.
                          The host performs READ and WRITE operations by coordinating multiple hardware FSMs: 
                          a Read/Write FSM for initiating transactions, a Protocol Handler FSM for managing packet-level 
                          operations (IN, OUT, DATA0, ACK, NAK) including retries, timeouts, and error handling, 
                          and serial encoding FSMs for bit stuffing, NRZI encoding, and CRC checking. 
                          The project involves layering FSMs to build a robust transaction protocol that handles 
                          errors and corrupted data while adhering to simplified USB communication rules. 
                          The testbench simulates an operating system, using predefined tasks (readData and writeData) 
                          to initiate memory transfers and validate results. You must design inter-FSM protocols,
                           tri-state drivers for D+ and D- lines, and implement layered Mealy machines for bitwise
                            data transmission and error recovery.

                    <img src="assets/images/projects/needle.jpg" alt="needle" class="project-image">
                    <p>The Needle framework is a custom deep learning library built from scratch,
                        featuring a flexible NDArray backend that supports efficient computations 
                        on both CPU and GPU. It includes an automatic differentiation engine for 
                        gradient-based optimization, enabling forward and backward passes on tensors. 
                        Needle provides essential neural network modules, such as linear layers, convolutions, RNNs, and LSTMs, 
                        for tasks like image classification (CIFAR-10) and language modeling (Penn Treebank). 
                        With its scalable training infrastructure, including data pipelines, optimizers, 
                        and data augmentation tools, Needle serves as a lightweight yet powerful framework for modern deep learning

                    <p>In this Network-on-Chip (NOC) project, I designed a simple communication system with two interconnected
                        routers and six nodes. Nodes serve as endpoints for sending and receiving 32-bit data packets, 
                        while routers handle packet routing using 8-bit transfers per clock cycle. The project is divided
                        into two parts: designing a Node module that interfaces with testbenches and routers, including 
                        buffering packets via a FIFO queue, and implementing a Router module that routes packets efficiently
                        and fairly across its four ports while handling concurrent data transfers. Routers must reassemble 
                        and transfer packets between nodes or other routers while adhering to handshaking protocols, 
                        prioritizing fairness (e.g., round-robin scheduling) and avoiding packet loss. 
                        The design emphasizes correctness, speed, and 
                        fairness to ensure all packets reach their correct destinations without overflow or bottlenecks.

                    <p>Working with a partner, we made a mini-RISC-V CPU using SystemVerilog. 
                        We support 15 ALU instructions, 8 registers in a register file, and memory 
                        read/write. To increase the efficiency of integer multiplication,
                        we made a multiplication co-processor and re-wrote the assembly 
                        file to manage memory more efficently. After adding the co-processor, we ran 
                        our CPU on an FPGA with the help of Quartus to examine the result. We decreased 
                        the average number of clock cycles requried from 500 to 75.

                    <p>Realizing the need to improve the bulletin boards across campus, 
                      we create a digiralized version of the bulletin board using Flutter. Students
                      can login to the main page via Google OAuth. All the posters are organized into 
                      different categories, and expired posters will be removed by our system. Students
                      can like the poster, make comments on posters, and post new content. To post a new poster,
                      student must specify upto 3 categories of the poster, and select an expiration date. All
                      of the business logic are handled by Firebase (authenticating users, keeping tracks of
                      all the posters liked by a user/posted by a user, and posting new content/removing 
                      old content). Additionally, we also have an admin-only page, where the admins can
                      check the posters, and only appropriate posters will be displayed on the main page.

                    <p>This is a software-hardware co-design project. We used HTML and CSS to create the 
                        website of Wordle game, and used JS to handle the game logic. Next, we used
                        SystemVerilog to add more complicated datapath and FSM: inserting coins to buy the
                        game, counting the number of games purchased, and computing the game logic 
                        and the game result. In the end, we synthesized the game on the FPGA, 
                        and designed the VGA interface to display the result on the screen.

                    <img src="assets/images/projects/cmud.jpg" alt="CMUD" class="project-image">
                    <p>Unlike a traditional MUD with a single application server, CMUD uses the globally distributed architecture shown in Figure 1. Players run the CMUD client app on their own
                        machine, which connects to a nearby (low ping) backend storage server. The CMUD client
                        is stateless, converting the player's inputs into queries against the backend storage server
                        and printing out the results. Different backend storage servers “sync” with each other (i.e.,
                        exchange data in the background) to maintain a single consistent global state, so that all
                        users see the same virtual world, including each others' actions.
                        The backend storage system itself implements a simple key-value store for string keys and
                        values. Specifically, it supports operations to Get and Put key value
                        pairs, plus an operation to List all key-value pairs starting with a given prefix. 
                        The advantage of this architecture is that it simplifies app development and deployment:
                        a cloud provider can run the same generic backend storage system for many apps, while
                        individual app developers only need to code and deploy their app's client, not their own
                        servers. This project is implemented using Go along with its RPCs and the MailBox system as the message queue.

                    <h3>Raft</h3>
                    <img src="assets/images/projects/raft.jpg" alt="Raft" class="project-image">
                    <p>Raft is a consensus algorithm for managing a replicated
                        log. It produces a result equivalent to (multi-)Paxos, and
                        it is as efficient as Paxos, but its structure is different
                        from Paxos; this makes Raft more understandable than
                        Paxos and also provides a better foundation for building practical systems. In order to enhance understandability, Raft separates the key elements of consensus, such as
                        leader election, log replication, and safety, and it enforces
                        a stronger degree of coherency to reduce the number of
                        states that must be considered. Results from a user study
                        demonstrate that Raft is easier for students to learn than
                        Paxos. Raft also includes a new mechanism for changing
                        the cluster membership, which uses overlapping majorities to guarantee safety. 
                        I replicated the system described in this paper using Go.

                    <p>This project is implemented using Go and has 2 parts: LSP Protocol and 
                        distributed bitcoin miner based on it. LSP is a networking protocol 
                        supporting client/server model with message acknoledging, checksum 
                        integrity checking, and reliability under bad network conditions. 
                        Based on such protocol, working as a team, we implemented the 
                        mining infruscture supporting brute force reverse hashing with a

                    <p>This project is implemented using C with a multi-threaded model. A proxy server is a computer program that acts as an intermediary between clients making requests to access
                        resources and the servers that satisfy those requests by serving content. A web proxy is a special type of
                        proxy server whose clients are typically web browsers and whose servers are web servers providing web
                        content. When a web browser uses a proxy, it contacts the proxy instead of communicating directly with
                        the web server; the proxy forwards the client’s request to the web server, reads the server’s response, then
                        forwards the response to the client.
